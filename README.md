# CodeWars-Projects

I am using this Repository to showcase my growth and talents in coding and to document my solved Kata on CodeWars.  
I've been using SQL for the last 8 years, and just added Python this year (2020).  
Hoping to improve and put in to practice my knowledge and move towards my goal of learning Full Stack in the next few years (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP).
